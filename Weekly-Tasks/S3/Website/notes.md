Models and controllers


User requests a resource via a URL (on the interface - View)
The controller is the logic that mediates between the user and the data/model.
Based on the logic you use to create your controller, it manipulates some data or displays to the users view.

Main components of an application
- Dependencies
- Properties
- wwwroot
- Controllers 
- Models
- View
- appsettings.jsons
- Program.cs
- Stratup.cs



Controllers are resp for handshakes, how you manipulate your data before you submit to yuor database

Models- data logic 

Views are the UI

appsetting contain logins, credentials, passwords, JWT tokens, server names - only constants to be stored

Program.cs - the starting point of the code

Dependencies - In frameworks we have a concept called ready made development. Not re-inventing the wheel. Package manager. 

wwwroot - includes the static files, CSS, Lib (bootstrap and jQuery), images, JS
